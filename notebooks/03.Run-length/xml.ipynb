    "In this section, you will learn how to resubmit a run and how to change the run length.  Much of the control of the running of your CESM simulation is done through  **XML** files.  XML stands for Extensible Markup Language.  The files that end in `.xml` in your case directory contain many variables that control the CESM simulation.  Figure 1 illustrates the various XML files that exist in the CESM case directory."

    "The most commonly used XML variables are located in `env_run.xml`.  This file contains variables that are used to control the characteristics of your simulation, such as the run length or whether it is a start up run or the continuation of a run.  These variables can be changed using the `xmlchange` command, which has the advantage over editing this file directly, that the change is propagated to all the necessary locations."
